AI Tutor Feedback Validation on Blockchain
This project demonstrates the use of blockchain technology (Aptos blockchain) to validate and store feedback for AI tutors. The feedback system ensures transparency, immutability, and security by utilizing the decentralized nature of blockchain.

Overview
The smart contract stores feedback from students about tutors, validates the feedback, and ensures that the feedback can be trusted and verified by all parties involved. Tutors can validate feedback from their students, and once validated, the feedback becomes part of the immutable ledger.

Key Features
Submit Feedback: Students can provide feedback about tutors, including a rating (1-5) and a comment.

Validate Feedback: Tutors or authorized users can validate the feedback to ensure its authenticity.

Transparency: All feedback and validation status are publicly visible on the blockchain, ensuring trust and transparency.

Immutability: Once feedback is stored on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity.

Smart Contract Details
The smart contract is written in Move, the language used by the Aptos blockchain. The contract contains three main functions:

submit_feedback: Allows a student to submit feedback for a tutor.

validate_feedback: Allows the tutor or an authorized user to validate the feedback submitted by a student.

get_feedback: Allows anyone to view feedback stored for a specific tutor.

Code Example
rust
Copy
module MyModule::AITutorFeedback {

    use aptos_framework::signer;
    use aptos_framework::coin;
    use aptos_framework::aptos_coin::AptosCoin;

    struct Feedback has store, key {
        student_address: address,  
        rating: u8,                
        comment: vector<u8>,       
        validated: bool,           
    }

    public fun submit_feedback(student: &signer, tutor_address: address, rating: u8, comment: vector<u8>) {
        assert!(rating >= 1 && rating <= 5, 1); 

        let feedback = Feedback {
            student_address: *signer::address_of(student),
            rating,
            comment,
            validated: false,
        };

        move_to(tutor_address, feedback);
    }

    public fun validate_feedback(tutor: &signer, student_address: address) acquires Feedback {
        let feedback = borrow_global_mut<Feedback>(student_address);

        assert!(!feedback.validated, 2);  

        feedback.validated = true;
    }

    public fun get_feedback(tutor_address: address) acquires Feedback {
        borrow_global<Feedback>(tutor_address)
    }
}
How to Use
Deploying the Smart Contract
Install Aptos CLI: Make sure you have the Aptos CLI installed on your machine. You can install it by following the official guide.

Deploy the contract: Compile and deploy the Move contract on the Aptos testnet or mainnet using the Aptos CLI.

Interacting with the Contract
Submit Feedback: A student can call the submit_feedback function to submit feedback about a tutor.

Validate Feedback: Tutors or authorized administrators can call the validate_feedback function to validate the feedback.

Retrieve Feedback: Anyone can retrieve the feedback using the get_feedback function, providing the tutor's address.

Project Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-tutor-feedback-blockchain.git
Install necessary dependencies (if applicable) and deploy the contract using the Aptos CLI.

Follow the steps to interact with the smart contract using the Aptos network.
